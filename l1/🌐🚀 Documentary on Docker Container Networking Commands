Networking in Docker is like giving your containers a voice 📢 to talk with each other, with your host machine 🖥️, and even with the outside world 🌍.

Docker provides multiple networking options, and each has its own commands.
Let’s explore them step by step, with symbols, signs, and examples 📝.

🔑 Basic Networking Commands

Command	Description	Example
docker network ls	📋 List all Docker networks	docker network ls
docker network inspect <network>	🔍 See full details of a network (subnet, gateway, containers attached)	docker network inspect bridge
docker network create <name>	🛠️ Create a new network	docker network create my-network
docker network rm <name>	🗑️ Remove a network	docker network rm my-network
docker run --network <name> <image>	🚢 Run a container in a specific network	docker run --network my-network nginx
docker network connect <network> <container>	🔗 Connect a running container to another network	docker network connect my-network my-container
docker network disconnect <network> <container>	❌ Disconnect a container from a network	docker network disconnect my-network my-container


🖧 Types of Docker Networks
1️⃣ Bridge Network (default)

Symbol: 🛤️ (bridge between containers and host)

Containers inside can talk to each other via internal IPs.

If -p option is used, it maps container ports to the host.

docker run -d --name web1 --network bridge nginx
docker run -d --name web2 --network bridge nginx


➡️ web1 and web2 can ping each other.

2️⃣ Host Network

Symbol: 🏠 (share house 🏡 = container shares host network)
Container uses host’s network directly (no NAT, no bridge).
Useful for performance or host-bound apps.
docker run -d --network host nginx


📌 Here, nginx will bind directly to your host machine’s ports.

3️⃣ None Network

Symbol: 🚫🌐 (no internet, no talk)

Container gets a network stack isolated from everything.
Useful for security testing.
docker run -d --network none busybox sleep 1000

4️⃣ Overlay Network

Symbol: 🌉🌍 (multi-host bridge)
Connects containers across multiple Docker hosts using Swarm.
Needed in production clusters.
docker network create -d overlay my-overlay

📖 Example Story (Step by Step)

👩‍💻 Imagine you’re launching two containers:

app (backend)

db (database)

You want them to talk privately 🔐.

# Step 1: Create a network

docker network create app-net

# Step 2: Run containers inside it
docker run -d --name db --network app-net mysql
docker run -d --name app --network app-net my-app-image


➡️ Now app can reach db using container name (db:3306).

🧾 Inspecting Networks (Deep Dive)
docker network inspect bridge


Output snippet (like you pasted):

"Subnet": "172.17.0.0/16",
"Gateway": "172.17.0.1",
"Containers": {
   "c11ae13628...": {
       "Name": "vigorous_lovelace",
       "IPv4Address": "172.17.0.2/16"
   }
}


📌 Breakdown:

Subnet → container IP pool
Gateway → bridge router IP

Containers → list of attached containers

⚡ Quick Revision Table

Network	Symbol	Communication	Use-case
Bridge	🛤️	Container ↔ Container (same host), NAT to outside	Default, development
Host	🏠	Container = Host	Performance, monitoring
None	🚫	No comms at all	Isolation, testing
Overlay	🌉🌍	Multi-host networking	Swarm, production clusters

🎯 Common Mistakes

❌ docker run --network my-network <container> → Wrong (you must give IMAGE, not container name).
✔️ Correct:

docker run --network my-network nginx

❌ docker network rm my-network → Error if container still attached.
✔️ First disconnect containers, then remove.

🏁 Final Thoughts

Think of Docker networks as roads 🚗:
Bridge = Local streets
Host = Your house driveway
None = No road at all

Overlay = Highway connecting cities

Mastering these commands makes you a Docker Networking Pro 🔥.
