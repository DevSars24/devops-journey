Docker Installation on Windows
==============================

System: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)

Steps Followed:
---------------

1. **Checked System Requirements**
   - Verified that my system supports virtualization (enabled via BIOS).
   - Confirmed Windows version compatibility for Docker Desktop.

2. **Downloaded Docker Desktop**
   - Went to the official Docker website: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
   - Clicked on "Download for Windows" (stable version).

3. **Installed Docker Desktop**
   - Ran the downloaded `.exe` installer.
   - Selected the option to use **WSL 2** backend (recommended).
   - Allowed the installer to configure WSL 2 and install necessary components.

4. **Enabled WSL 2**
   - Opened PowerShell as Administrator.
   - Ran the following commands:
     ```
     dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
     dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
     ```
   - Restarted my PC.
   - Installed the **Linux kernel update package** from Microsoftâ€™s website.
   - Set WSL 2 as the default version:
     ```
     wsl --set-default-version 2
     ```

5. **Completed Installation**
   - After restart, launched Docker Desktop.
   - Accepted license agreement.
   - Waited for Docker to start and verify installation.

6. **Verified Installation**
   - Opened Command Prompt or PowerShell.
   - Ran:
     ```
     docker --version
     ```
     Output showed installed Docker version.

7. **Tested Docker**
   - Ran the hello-world test container:
     ```
     docker run hello-world
     ```
   - Confirmed Docker is working successfully.

Notes:
------
- Ensure virtualization is enabled in BIOS.
- WSL 2 is recommended over Hyper-V for better performance.
- If using Windows Home, only WSL 2 backend is supported.
