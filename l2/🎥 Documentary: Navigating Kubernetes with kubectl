📘 Kubernetes kubectl Commands – A Quick Reference Documentary


🎥 Lecture Recap: Walkthrough of Useful kubectl Commands

Welcome back! In this session, we explore one of the most practical aspects of Kubernetes – mastering kubectl commands. While we’ve used kubectl for deployments, services, and pods before, this lecture focuses on collecting everything in one place and making your workflow faster, cleaner, and more efficient.

🌐 The Official Kubernetes Documentation

The best place to learn and verify kubectl commands is the official documentation:

👉 Kubernetes.io Documentation

Here you will find:

Concepts → Learn the theory behind Kubernetes objects (Pods, Deployments, Services, etc.)
Tasks → Step-by-step guides for performing administrative and installation tasks
Tutorials → Hands-on lessons for deeper learning
Reference Guides → Detailed command explanations and YAML samples

📌 Pro Tip: Bookmark the kubectl Cheat Sheet page:

👉 kubectl Quick Reference

This acts as your all-in-one command reference with examples and YAML templates.

⌨️ Speeding Up Your Kubernetes Workflow
Typing kubectl hundreds of times can be tiring. Let’s make our terminal smarter.

1️⃣ Enable Bash Auto-Completion

Instead of typing full commands, use TAB completion:

# Install bash completion (Ubuntu/Debian)

sudo apt-get install bash-completion
# Enable kubectl auto-completion
source <(kubectl completion bash)

# Add permanently in ~/.bashrc
echo "source <(kubectl completion bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc


Now, typing kubectl get p[TAB] will automatically expand to:

kubectl get pods

2️⃣ Create an Alias for kubectl

Typing kubectl every time? Let’s shorten it to just k:

# Add alias
alias k=kubectl

# Make it permanent
echo "alias k=kubectl" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc


✅ Now you can simply type:

k get pods
k get deploy


Instead of the longer version.

🛠️ Commonly Used kubectl Commands

Here are some of the most frequent commands you’ll use daily:

Command	Description
kubectl get pods	List all pods
kubectl get svc	List all services
kubectl get nodes	Show all nodes
kubectl get deployments	List deployments
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>	Show detailed pod info
kubectl logs <pod-name>	Fetch pod logs
kubectl apply -f file.yaml	Apply a YAML configuration
kubectl delete -f file.yaml	Delete a resource from YAML
kubectl exec -it <pod> -- bash	Access pod shell

📌 Advanced commands like --watch, jsonpath, and resource scaling are available in the cheat sheet.

⚡ Hands-on YAML Examples

The cheat sheet also provides sample YAML templates for resources like Pods, Deployments, and Services. These are great for quickly starting projects. Example:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80


Apply it:

kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml

🧠 Key Takeaways

Always bookmark the kubectl cheat sheet for quick references.

Use auto-completion + aliasing to save time.

Master frequent commands (get, describe, apply, delete, logs, exec).

Explore YAML templates for faster deployment.

For advanced usage, dive into jsonpath, selectors, and scaling.

🎯 Closing Note

This video emphasized efficiency in working with Kubernetes. Knowing commands is good, but knowing how to quickly use and find them is even better.

✅ Next Step for You:
Try enabling auto-completion + alias on your terminal, bookmark the Kubernetes cheat sheet, and start practicing kubectl commands like a pro.
